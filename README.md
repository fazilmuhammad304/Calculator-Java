🧮 Java Non-Stop Calculator – Extended Description
This is a simple, interactive command-line calculator built in Java that supports continuous arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) without restarting. The calculator runs in a loop, accepting multiple operations until the user ends the session with an = operator.

✅ Key Features
➕ Perform non-stop (chained) calculations

🔁 Accepts operators and numbers in a loop

🔣 Supports basic arithmetic: +, -, *, /

📉 Shows real-time results after each operation

⌛ Ends only when user inputs =

🧠 Designed for easy learning and logic building

🛠️ Where You Can Run It
You can run this Java calculator in any of the following platforms:

VS Code (Visual Studio Code) – Use Java extensions and the terminal.

Eclipse IDE – Simply create a new Java project and run the file.

Online Java Compilers – Such as:

Replit

JDoodle

OnlineGDB

Programiz

Just paste the code, run it, and start calculating!

▶️ How It Works
You input a starting number

Choose an operator (+, -, *, /, or =)

Enter the next number

The calculator updates and displays the current result

Repeat until you enter =, which shows the final result and exits
